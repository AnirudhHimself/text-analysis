# A basic word cloud

This repo contains a wordcloud of all the tweets the president sent during the government shut down. It was created in R. The key design choice is choosing the color orange to match the president's spray tan.

I don't believe that word clouds are all that useful because they separate us from much of the semantic context that we're used to enjoying when reading. However, that doesn't mean they can't be fun to make.
